We wanted to find solve a problem that we all faced, and those around us also did. This led us to look at how
we could improve the student experience at UW as that is a trait we all share.

One of the key parts of being a college student is managing the life around your studies, as at this point, you've 
likely left home and have significantly more priorities. Other than just those in a group, we talked with our 
friends in order to establish a true need for the app. What we noticed is that many people felt like there were 
so many apps that they need to access in order to get the information that they need throughout the day. 

In order to solve this issue, we wanted to create a cohesive app that could be used by all UW students for everything
they would need in a typical school day.

We analyzed what we typically need to do on our phones related to UW, and decided to add that to our feature set. The 
first thing that came to mind was keeping track of all the various UW specific websites including canvas, MyUW, and MyPlan.
Another thing was the food that students need to find throughout the day. Somtimes you want to eat on campus, and other 
times you want to try something else. On top of this, you want to find activities near by in order to relax after school. 
Finally, we also realize that we needed a way to stay on top of work when we weren't actively doing it. This would mean 
including a calendar and to do list. 

We took this list of features and asked our friends how they would find it and they agreed it would be significantly helpful
to have all of these in one place, to acess throughout the day on campus.
