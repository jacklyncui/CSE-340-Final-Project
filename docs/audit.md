# Final Project Audit
Overall, group 14 did a fantastic job on their final project. During our zoom call, Michael walked me through their app, showing me all of its features and I had him run various tests to check its accessibility. The app has clear semantic labels for all of its content, it resizes well, the menus are easy to navigate through, and most of the colors in the app contrast very well. The only contrast issue I found was the dates on the calendar that are from the previous or following month are light gray on a white background which can be hard to see for people with low visibility. We talked about how this is sort of the standard color decision for calendars because those dates aren’t a part of the current month, and therefore the lighter color indicates that they aren’t currently important. For the purposes of this class, I recommended changing the color so that it’s easier to read. We also talked about making the text throughout the app a larger font size to both fill empty space on the screen and to make it easier to read. Finally, we talked about how both of our apps could benefit from having a help window that the user can open from the main page to get a description of the app and how to use its various features.
